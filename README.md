websplit
========

WIP LiveSplit inspired (style) web browser based timer with splits.

[Live Demo](https://iotku.pw/websplit)

Currently being tested mostly with Chrome and Firefox, while trying to keep IE10+ compatibility (But not guaranteed). Other modern browsers should work, but are untested.

About WebSplit
=====

Abandon hope all ye who enter here: Welcome to my first attempt at doing stuff with javascript.

A while ago I had the idea of adding splits to http://w00ty.com/sda/timer/ but I never really stuck with it (and had zero javascript knowledge).

Now I'm mostly learning as I go and this timer is almost functional, and looks half decent on top of it.

There's still a fair bit of stuff I need to work out, but this is pretty much the furthest I've gotten with anything programming related.

Good luck, have fun.
